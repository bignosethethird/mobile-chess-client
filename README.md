# Mobile Chess Client
A chess client for Android mobile phone-sized devices that was developed using MIT App Inventor

# A What?
This is a Prototype Chess Client that interfaces with the nearly unbeatable Stockfish Chess Engine. It was cobbled together with the MIT App Inventor as an experiment to see how this toolkit can be pushed. Well, it turns out to have some limitations to the professional programmer!

# Installation
Method 1: Import the .aia project file in the build directory into MIT App Inventor at http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/ after having created an account for yourself. Then get AI to build the project file for you, which you can then then install on your mobile phone using the QR-Code that will be shown at the end of the building process. 

Method 2: Copy the .apk application file directly your mobile phone's Download directory via USB or whatever, and launch the file from there using Android  File Explorer or similar. 

Note that in both cases you need to allow unvalidated applications to be installed on your mobile phone. The setting for this varies between Android releases.
